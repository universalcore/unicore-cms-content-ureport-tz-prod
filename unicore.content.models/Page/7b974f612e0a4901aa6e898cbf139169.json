  "content": "Typhoid fever is caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi. It is spread through contaminated water and food sources with faecal material containing Salmonella Typhi bacteria. Symptoms include high grade fever of 39 to 40 degrees celsius, stomach pains, weakness, headache, loss of appetite and a rash of flat rose coloured spots in severe cases.\r\n\r\nIt is diagnosed after a stool sample or blood is tested for the presence of Salmonella Typhi. If one suffers from typhoid fever, he or she may still continue to carry the bacteria even after the symptoms have disappeared. \r\n\r\n\r\n[Ur Story][1]\r\n\r\n[U-Act][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://iogt.qa-hub.unicore.io/page/c980a53bfd86457abb2b50b166aadf66/\r\n  [2]: http://iogt.qa-hub.unicore.io/page/f18cab36f8a04c62b0250a0f0361d316/",
